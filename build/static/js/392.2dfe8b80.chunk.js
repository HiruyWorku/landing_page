I built a fully functional backyard gym out of curiosity, but the real career path-shaping event was the discovery of computer science. Programming's object-oriented thinking changed the way I approached problems, converting anxiety into strategizing and perplexity into a teaching opportunity. As a sophomore studying computer science, my goal is to work as a full-stack developer with an increasing emphasis on Backend dev. , AI, and ML. For backend programming, I have practical expertise with Python, Java, C, and SQL. For frontend solutions, I have worked with JavaScript, React.js, CSS, and HTML.
